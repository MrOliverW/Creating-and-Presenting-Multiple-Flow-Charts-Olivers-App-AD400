1.	Basic Flow Chart
	The basic flow chart shows the project progression form left to right with the main phases outlined. This is great for an easily digestible data visualization. Some challenges involve overthinking the shapes I was going to use. I also decided to create via Miro boards because I found Confluence’s templates to be somewhat user-unfriendly.
2.	System Flow Chart
	The system flow chart dives into the Oliver’s app project in more depth; exploring the various situations that may arise throughout the project. Mainly, what happens if the app is ready for the next step and what happens if the app is not ready for the next step. I don’t think this project is complex enough for a system flow chart but I enjoyed the process of making it.
3.	Workflow Diagram
	The workflow diagram represents a breakdown of each task required in each phase of the project. The diagram isn’t as easy to digest as a basic flow chart but could be good for the team to have a visual picture of the entirety of the project. This diagram does a great job of identifying bottle neck in a project! I was challenged by the desired to want to over-format the style of the diagram.
4.	Data Flow Chart
	The dataflow chart does a good job of identifying who is responsible for each task. The chat is more challenging to digest than the workflow diagram but can provide team members greater insight into how their roles will influence the project. It goes into great detail while keeping things visually appealing but takes more effort to create.
5.	Decision Flow Chart
	The decision flow chart I created is broken down by color. This allows team members to visualize where they are key contributors throughout the process as well as visualize who they will be dependent upon and who will be dependent upon them. 
6.	Swimlane Flow Chart
	The Swimlane flow chart is probably the least challenging way for each team member to get a grasp on their responsibilities throughout the project. The chart is color coded and laid out chronologically. I decided to remove the spaces where team members had no responsibilities for visual appeal. I found this to be the most ideal chart for team members however depending on the person, they may have their preferences. These diagrams along with a WBS, Project Charter, and elevator pitch help solidify the project.
